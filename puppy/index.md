# My Life with Bonnie üêæ

I have always known that I wanted a dog and I have always wanted a Labrador! I grew up with labradors and I grew especially attached to the second family dog. She is not alive anymore but from the moment I moved away from home I have wanted labrador for myself. I wanted to name her after the second family dog which first name was Bonnie (but we later renamed her Trine) and from the end of Marts 2025 I brought home a little labrador puppy that I have named Bonnie.
